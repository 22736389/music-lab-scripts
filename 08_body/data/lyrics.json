circumstances do you start with music do you start with lyrics and my answer is always that it happens differently every time and that s why i m still so in love with song writing so what i ve done here is shown you three different examples of the beginning stages of these songs and how they each started different ways so i ll explain them to you and maybe that will help you understand kind of how i put songs together i sent this voice memo to ryan tedder because i d always wanted to work with him and finally we scheduled some studio time so i always wanna be prepared i wanted to send him the idea that i was working on before we went into the studio just in case he wrote back and said i can t stand that i wanna work on something else think of something else so i just sat down with the piano put my phone on top of the piano and just kind of explained to him where i wanted to go with the song how i saw the melody sitting in and we ended up recording the song the next day and it ended up being on the record called i know places so this was the voice memo i sent to him the night before we ended up finishing the song okay so this is kind of this rough idea thing uh-uh-uh-oh oh-oh-oh-i oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh-i oh-oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh-i-i-i na na na na waiting at the back door they re around and the vultures come around and you know that they won t they won t us say what they want bout say what they want bout us and you come and sing and listen i would not think about it but i m not done every know that a thing or two about it thing or two about it i cause they got the cages

a mean mug and it looked so familiar that he called him young cuz told him get off the strip but the boy ain t budge fuck you instead he pulled out a newer thirty-eight snub he clearly had the drop but the boy just paused hold up there was somethin in this man s face he knew he seen before it s like lookin in the mirror seein hisself more mature and he took it as a sign from the almighty lord
