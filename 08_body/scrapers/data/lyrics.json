Know Places (Voice Memo)", "lyrics": "so over the years a lot of people have asked me to sort of describe my song writing process from beginning to end how long does it take where do you write what are the circumstances do you start with music do you start with lyrics and my answer is always that it happens differently every time and that s why i m still so in love with song writing so what i ve done here is shown you three different examples of the beginning stages of these songs and how they each started different ways so i ll explain them to you and maybe that will help you understand kind of how i put songs togetheri sent this voice memo to ryan tedder because i d always wanted to work with him and finally we scheduled some studio time so i always wanna be prepared i wanted to send him the idea that i was working on before we went into the studio just in case he wrote back and said i can t stand that i wanna work on something else think of something else so i just sat down with the piano put my phone on top of the piano and just kind of explained to him where i wanted to go with the song how i saw the melody sitting in and we ended up recording the song the next day and it ended up being on the record called i know places so this was the voice memo i sent to him the night before we ended up finishing the song okay so this is kind of this rough idea thing uh-uh-uh-oh oh-oh-oh-ioh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh-ioh-oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh-i-i-ina na na na waiting at the back doorthey re around and the vultures come aroundand you know that they won t they won t ussay what they want bout
