Data-Driven DJ
=================

[Data-Driven DJ](https://datadrivendj.com) by [Brian Foo](http://brianfoo.com) is a series of music experiments that combine data, algorithms, and borrowed sounds. This repository includes all necessary scripts and assets to build the songs from scratch. Free free to replicate, adapt, and extend. Shoot me an email at [hello@brianfoo.com](mailto:hello@brianfoo.com) if you have any questions or if you want to share what you created from this code.

Click through to each track's sub-folder for individual README documents for how to setup and configure each song.

* [Track 1: Two Trains](/tree/master/01_subway)
* [Track 2: Rhapsody In Grey](/tree/master/02_brain)
* Track 3: Airplay (under construction, coming soon)
